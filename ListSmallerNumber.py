# Take a list, say for example this one:
#  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

# traversing = iteration
numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
for anElement in numbers:
    if anElement < 5:
        print(anElement)
        
print("Hello editted ") 

print("I am making changes")
